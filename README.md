The purpose of this application is to be a holistic view of my development exercises, projects, and other meanderings. My goal is that when I come across something challenging, I can keep a living, hosted, journal of my solutions on the web.

* Code challenges / exercises
* Unit testing
* Interview questions and solutions
* Discoveries
